# Smart Blind Stick – Embedded System Project

## Description
A low-cost embedded system designed to assist visually impaired people by detecting obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and providing alerts via vibration, buzzer, and LED.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Vibration Sensor
- Buzzer
- LED
- Battery

## Software & Tools
- Embedded C
- Arduino IDE

## Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to obstacles. If the distance is below a predefined threshold or vibration is detected, the system triggers an alert using buzzer and LED.

## Applications
- Assists visually impaired people during walking
- Obstacle detection in indoor environments

## Future Scope
- GPS integration for navigation
- Voice guidance
- PCB design for compactness
